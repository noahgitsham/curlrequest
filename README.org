* Handling Requests from Curl
A simple example for how to handle requests from curl separately from a browser.
This is example is with Flask, but same idea should apply to any backend.

This is probably how the [[https://alx.sh][Asahi Linux install script]] can redirect
to their website when ran from a browser, but returns the install script when curled

** Running the Example
Make sure to install Flask if you haven't already.
`flask --app flaskr run`
